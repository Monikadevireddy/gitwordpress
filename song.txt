I wanna code
until I grow old
It's a pretty good lifestyle

it's really great
if you can create
You will wake up with a smile

An old mechanic that I met one day
said that there's only one problem
If you think that there's two Its confusing you
Scratch your head and start over

C-Sharp is cool
down by the pool
Just so long as there's broad band

Or by the lake
don't take a break
keep your computer on dry land

If in doubt do the mobile first
then your page will be responsive
Your work will look good from an ipad on the couch
So long as you have the right glasses

Java is to drink
It makes you think
Better sign up for spring training

Bankers like it a lot
Especially hot
It helps them to know if their profiting

An old mechanic that I met one day
said that there's only one problem
If you think that there's two Its confusing you
Scratch your head and start over

I wanna code
until I grow old
It's a pretty good lifestyle

it's really great
if you can create
You will wake up with a smile
